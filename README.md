# NodeJS, TypeScript, PostgreSQL social messaging API
A social messaging API written in TypeScript and NodeJS.
This is an experimental/learning project.
The goal of the project - is to create an API for a messaging platform inspired by popular social networks.
This project strives to be highly modular from the beginning, with easy pluggable modules. As application grows, these modules could, later, become standalone microservices.

The project is fully free and open for anyone to join.
